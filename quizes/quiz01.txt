    a) Everything will be got from your machine, therefore the browser doesn't need to go to any server. 
    b) First the browser request the IP of the host on the DNS server, after it makes a GET 
    request to the server where the index page is, then it receives the file from that server 
    and then render the html and also any resourse it needs to display its contents, if the 
    resourses are in the cache of the browser it gets it from there otherwise it goes to the server 
    where they are and get it from there.

6) Because it needs to access the content of the file, when the file is locally placed 
on my machine (local server) it is not reachable from the validator server, because my IP is private.

8) By default block elements takes the whole line of the screen while inline only takes the part needed.
9) Because tables have semantics and it should be used only to display tables. Also, we should use css for 
styling instead, otherwise we create a complex struture without any need.
10) Because of accessibility, we can develop applications that can use alt texts to describe the images for blind people.
