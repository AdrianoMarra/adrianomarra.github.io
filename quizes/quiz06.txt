1) Hoisting is the first phase where the JavaScript interpreter put the
code in order (moves the declarations to the top) before actually running the code. 
Don't relly on Hoisting always declare you variables and functions before using them 
and also use let and const if you are using ES6 or "use sctrict" if using ES5.

2) Window and document are JS global objects, Window refers to the entire window, 
while document refers to the html document. Document is actually a property of window.

3) the second statements booyah() is called before waiting for the 2 seconds;

4) let does not include the variable to the window scope, and it prevents scope liking, and also prevents hoisting;

5) const has the same scope as let, however const cannot be changed. Therefore the performance 
of the code is better because JS does not need to check for changes on consts.

6)  a) false;
    b) false;
    c) true;

7) you can include "use sctrict" on the first line of the JS document or on the first line of function, which is 
the best option because you prevent breaking code that already exists in other parts of the system.
