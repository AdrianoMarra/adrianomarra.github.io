Relative: behaves the same as static unless you add some
offsets to adjust its normal position. Other content will 
not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Fixed: A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means
it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

Absolute: absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest
positioned ancestor (containing element) instead of relative to the
viewport and when you scroll the page, it moves.

When we use float property is used in a element the following elements by 
default will try to fit in any blank space left by the floating elements. 
If you want the following elements not to fit inside the blank spots we 
should use the clear property.
